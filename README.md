# Morpion
School Project: Tic-Tac-Toe

There isn't too much to talk about...

It's a Tic-Tac-Toe (Morpion) game with AI, that can play in 3 levels, playable in the console.
Level one is basically an IA which plays randomly,
Level two just wants to win the game...
And the third level is... the one you can't defeat.

You can find all details in the `main.py` program, with comments in French.
